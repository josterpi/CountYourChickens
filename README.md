# CountYourChickens
Simulation of the children's cooperative board game

This Christmas (2019), we got the board game [Count Your Chickens][1]. After a few plays and inspired by the memory of a fun write-up on a [simulation of Chutes & Ladders][2], I decided to program a quick simulation of Count Your Chickens to answer the question: what's the probability that you'll lose?

The results of this simulation suggest that you'll actually lose about 40% of the time. On 10,000 runs, I count 6,002 wins and 3,998 loses. The mean number of chicks that you can get into the henhouse before the game ends is 39.84.

And then Christmas break ended and I went back to work, so that's where this story ends.
